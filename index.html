                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <img src="images/gertrude.webp" alt="Profile Image">
                <p>Hello! My name is Gertrude Njideka and I am from Abia State in the South-Eastern region of Nigeria.
                    I enjoy listening to music. I am currently enrolled at Brigham Young University Idaho to study
                    software development.
                    I look forward to the numerous coding classes that we will have. I am driven by a passion for
                    technology, and innovation,
                    coding, and problem-solving applications, aiming to build innovative software solutions. Through
                    this program, I hope to
                    gain expertise in programming, software engineering principles, and modern development tools;
                    preparing for a successful
                    career in the tech industry.</p>
        
                <h2 class="country">Abia State, Nigeria</h2>
                <img src="images/abia-state.webp" alt="Abia State Image" class="flag">
                    <p> Abia State is located in the southeastern region of Nigeria.
                        It's bordered by the states of Imo, Cross River, Rivers, Anambra, Enugu, and Ebonyi.
                        Abia State was carved out of the former Imo State in 1991. The name "Abia" is an abbreviation
                        of four of the state's densely populated regions Aba, Bende, Isuikwuato, and Afikpo. It is one
                        of the thirty-six (36) States that constitute the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Abia people are
                        of
                        the igbo ethnic group who predominates much of the Southeastern part of Nigeria. Their
                        traditional
                        language is Igbo. English is widely spoken and serves as the official language in governance and
                        business.
                        Abia State has tropical rainforests in the south and woodland savanna in the north.
                        The state has sedimentary structures like mud cracks, cross-bedding, and burrows.</p>
